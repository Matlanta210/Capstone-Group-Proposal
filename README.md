# Capstone Group Proposal
ECPI Capstone Group Proposal


<h2>Description</h2>
In our capstone project, my team and I created a group proposal for a hospital that was requesting a new internet service provider and network design to ensure HIPAA compliance, information and data security, network stability, and efficiency. Our goal was to assist the medical facility in achieving their goals of securing network and patient data to remain HIPAA compliant and conduct business using a state of the art system.


I personally configured the network configuration and segmentation of all devices and services using Cisco Packet Tracer. I also wrote the disaster recovery and business continuity plan, automated vulnerability management scans, patches, and backups for our network. The hospital desired a new internet provider that could provide state of the art service by establishing, overseeing, managing, and maintaining a secure, robust, redundant network capable of serving as a cloud-based repository for sensitive patient PHI, while providing easy accessibility by all Healthcare facilities within the network, including hospitals, staff, pharmacies, and patients while maintaining compliance with federal and state regulations. The process of putting together our groups proposal came with some challenges but staying focused on the main goal and end result helped us succeed in securing the bid. In this project, I will go over the slide show as a part of the proposal we submitted to the stake holders.

On the agenda tonight, we will be discussing how our proposed network design will mitigate security oversights and ensure HIPAA compliance, information and data security, network stability and efficiency.

Our goal is to assist the medical facility achieve their goals of securing the network and patient data, remain compliant with HIPAA, and conduct business using a state of the art system.: <br/>

<br />
<br />
So what are the goals of the medical facility? 

We understand that your organization desires a new internet service provider who can deliver state of the art internet services by establishing, overseeing, managing, and maintaining a secure, robust, redundant network, that is capable of serving as a cloud-based repository for sensitive patient electronic health records, allowing easy accessibility by all healthcare facilities within the network, including the hospitals, medical staff, pharmacies, and patients themselves, while maintaining compliance with federal and state regulations.:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
To comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, Team Delta will establish MOTD disclosures on all end user devices, patient portals, and any site in which stakeholders or third-party associates can access. Copies of this HIPAA Privacy Disclosure can be obtained electronically via the patient portal, should one be requested.:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
To ensure this rule is complied with, The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) created a Cybersecurity Framework for all cybersecurity professionals to follow. This framework consists of 5 functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

To ensure 100% HIPAA compliance, Team Delta will inventory all physical devices, systems, software platforms, and applications. These resources will be prioritized based on their classification, criticality, and business value. Security policies will be established to govern and manage cybersecurity risks. Access to physical assets will be managed and protected at all times. 

Team Delta will also ensure network integrity is protected through network segregation and incident alerts. Our team will perform regular vulnerability scans and monitor for unauthorized personnel, devices, software and malicious code. We will periodically test our detection processes and work continuously to improve them. Any newly identified vulnerabilities will be documented and mitigated.

Should an event occur, you can have peace of mind knowing our staff is trained and aware of their roles and responsibilities in the event of an incident response. Our disaster response plan will be executed immediately to contain the incident and future response strategies will be updated. 

After an event, we will execute our recovery plan to manage public relations and repair reputation. :  <br/>

<br />
<br />
To comply with HIPAA requirements, should the facility become a victim of a cyberattack, the facility must immediately report the crime to the appropriate law enforcement agencies, this can include state or local law enforcement and the FBI. 

Any cyber threat indicators must be reported to all federal and information-sharing and analysis organizations, including the Department of Homeland Security. 

Any breach must be reported to the Office for Civil rights as soon as possible, but must not be reported no later than 60 days after the discovery of a breach that affects 500 or more individuals.  

Affected individuals and the media must be notified immediately, unless law enforcement officials have requested a delay in the reporting.

An exploitation of vulnerabilities in a medical facility can impose serious legal, reputational, and monetary risks. :  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Risk to your medical data can come in many forms;  We understand those risk and the security of your sensitive data will be our number one priority. To protect your facility from those risks, Team Delta is proposing a secure and elaborate network that is redundant and highly scalable. 

As you can see from this topology, each medical facility connects directly with the Network Operations Center, with a secure and reliable VPN connection which is monitored and managed 24/7 by our Network Operation Center. Medical facilities will connect to the NOC’s portal through a combination of private and public secure VPN connections for redundancy. 

These connections are highly resilient, and they will provide the medical facility with a reliable, uninterrupted, encrypted network connection with the NOC. 

The Network Operation Center (NOC) will be the command center that controls user authentication and access to the cloud hosted medical database. The NOC’s network system is designed with proper access controls that will accurately identify, validate and track users gaining access to the medical records database. :  <br/>

<br />
<br />
The NOC will be responsible for creating the security policies, security procedures and analyzing access reports and access logs routinely using a system information & event management (SIEM) solution. 

We have designed the medical facilities network topology with segmented networks, unified threat management firewalls and secure routers that have Access Control Lists (ACLs) that will permit or deny traffic to various locations within the network. 

Free internet access will be provided to all guest of the medical center, The guest internet access network will be segregated outside of the medical centers primary network. By segregating the networks, your facility can feel confident knowing that all guest traffic is away from the internal network and your patient data is secure. :  <br/>

<br />
<br />
An Amazon Relational Database Service will be used to store patients protected health information, securely in the cloud. 

To serve as a functional cloud-based database repository, we will utilize the AWS Aurora Relational Database Services, which will be hosted and available in multiple regions and availability zones. This service allows for high network availability, access, and redundancy. This secure cloud-based solution provider will also be used as a backup for all medical, accounting, and human resource data from the medical centers. 

We will be using Windows Server 2019 with Active Directory Domain Services to control access to the database. Users and security groups will be created to manage access and authentication. Using Active Directory will also allow us to create complex username and password requirements and restrict access by incorporating the principles of least privilege and separation of duties. 

A HIPPA compliant patient portal will give patients access to a customized cloud-based web application. This application will share personal information with the patient and allow them to make appointments, order prescriptions and communicate securely with their medical teams. This web app will be hosted in Amazon Web Services (AWS) as an EC2 instance. Two-factor authentication will be needed to access the web application and the patients' passwords will be required to change yearly. :  <br/>

<br />
<br />
The network will be monitored with network and host-based intrusion detection and prevention systems, and all network traffic will be monitored and managed through the Network Operations Center.

Our proposed network is designed with physical and technical safeguards to meet HIPAA security standards using a multi-cloud infrastructure. As the organization expands, scalability is not a problem as the network designs and our security enhancements and features are built and designed with future growth in mind.:  <br/>

<br />
Our Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity plan will be developed around an efficient back up and reconstruction plan based on our mission to ensure that in the event of any disaster that disrupts business, we are able to get business operations up and running as soon as possible. 
Our network and data backups will be stored both in our 3rd party cloud service as well as in a warm offsite location to ensure access in the event of an outage that results in us not being able to first access the cloud backup. :  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/vgzUmaH.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br />
<br />
Everyone in the group has an active role in ensuring that our Disaster Recovery Plan is consistently updated as we will meet up once every two weeks to go over our plan. Testing will be done routinely each quarter of the year and will be continuously updated when necessary with our team members fully aware of changes and are educated to be fully prepared in the event of a disaster

Roles and objective will be written out and we will include two backup personal to fill in if necessary. We also inform our stakeholder informed of any plan changes as well as insight in the direction go for any said disaster. 

A template will be included in our references section. :  <br/>

Thankfully, there are many devices we can continue to use from the existing network, however, the pieces of equipment we will need to introduce to the network are the most expensive. In the technological age, we must pay for the peace of mind network security offers. 

We will introduce 16 new Palo Alto PAN-PA 850 firewalls, 5 new Cisco Catalyst 2960 Switches, and 4 Linksys WRT300 Wireless Routers for patient access. Malwarebytes will be installed on 12 servers and 9 end user devices.

The upfront cost of approximately $200,000 for this proposed design is substantially less than the potential costs your facility could face, should there be a HIPAA violation or cyberattack. In addition to the costs you see on screen, this will also include the first year of the various AWS services we will be using.

Regular maintenance of the network and annual costs after the implementation of these devices will reduce significantly. After the upfront cost, annual costs thereafter will primarily be for malware and antivirus software, AWS, and employee wages. 

To put it simply, investing in security measures now, can prevent future negative impacts to your offices. :  <br/>
